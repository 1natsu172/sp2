# sp2
`sp2` is a set of JavaScript modules using syntax for **State-operating Procedures with Portability**.
Portability means that procedures are expressed by JSON data. This makes procedures portable and applicable over different environments.

This concept of "portable operation" is inspired by MongoDB. In fact, sp2 uses similar syntaxes as MongoDB's operations in its modules.
